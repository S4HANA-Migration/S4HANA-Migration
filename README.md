- ⚡ Fun fact: Hello, our support involves accelerating the migration of SAP data to SAP S/4HANA by automating this process.
- . At each step of the data migration process, you can do it yourself or outsource this small part of the work to another AI Agent.
-  Thanks to our SAAS model, you only become a person supervising the correctness of subsequent steps in the implementation of this data migration.
